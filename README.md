# old-bgt-stuff
 
This is some small games and examples I created from 2010 to 2012.\
Feel free to use it for whatever you want.\
To compile you will need the bgt engine, which can be [downloaded from the audiogames archive here](https://agarchive.net/games/blastbay/bgt_english_installer.exe).\
Enjoy.
